### Personal Information

- **Name: Franz Pretorius**
- **Date: 2024/03/04**
- **Current Role/Position: Student at CodeSpace**
- **Field of Interest: Web Development**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise.
    - Identify skills you need to develop or improve.

    Currently I know Java, C++, Visual Basic, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the CSS Framework Tailwind.
    I am able to develop basic C++ and Java applications as well as develop full-stack websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    I can definitely improve my knowledge in all these languages as I only have basic knowledge of each.

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.
    - What values are important to you in a work environment?

    I love any form of software development, be it a Java application, a web-app, a website etc. 
    Any form of project that is created via code is extremely satisfying to create.
    As an aspiring full-stack web developer in terms of values in the workspace that I regard as extremely important are as follows:
    -Respect of each other's time.
    -Dedication to your work.
    -Clear communication skills.
    -Professionalism.
    -Good practice in terms of coding.
    -Clear understanding of individual work done as well as understanding of the overall project.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched.
    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.

    Roles I have researched include:
    -Software Developer
    -Software Engineer
    -Web Developer
    -Web Designer
    -IT Project Management
    -Database Engineer

    Most of the above named fields piqued my interest as I have come across sections in studying that link to these fields and have enjoyed most of them. 

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.

    I have realised that in-depth backend programming isn't for me, I would prefer a designing role or an analysing role, because I do like numbers, or ultimately project management because I would say my leadership skills are pretty good. I just love tech in general, but most importantly I like aesthetics and designing.
    Some of the gaps I do however have are that of experience, I haven't seen enough of the possible things that I would want to be able to learn and do, this flaw will however be bridged by just further studying and practicing.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

    -Finish studying
    -Getting a job as a junior developer
    -Moving out
    -Get involved in trading

    Firstly, I want to finish studying at CodeSpace to solidify my knowledge in web development.
    I then want to within a few months of graduating get a job and move out, as that is the next big step in my life and my career.
    I want to get involved in trading as a secondary income, since starting as a junior developer the salary won't be as high.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.

    -Solidifying my role as an experienced developer
    -Learning other languages
    -Upskilling myself to ensure I'm the best for myself and the company I work for
    -Work on personal projects

    3 years in I would want to be a senior developer in the company I work for, I would during my time at the company also want to learn more programming languages to further broaden my opportunities and expertise at the company. I want to be the best version of myself and prove to the company that I am a valuable asset. I also want to work on several personal projects as they are a fun way to learn new things and upskill yourself and keep in touch with your field and interest.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
    - Include any resources or support required.

    Completing my studies at CodeSpace would require me to engage in all the content week in and week out and ensure I am up to date with content, lectures and projects, attendance is the most important.
    Getting my first job would require me to learn how to navigate interviews, how to speak professionally, calm and say the things that the potential company would want to hear and expect from me. To keep the job I would just need to perform well, work hard and upskill myself. CodeSpace have already given us a lot of helpful resources to help us keep up with the tech industry, I would keep those resources closeby.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.

    For my long-term goals I firstly need to solidify my short-term goals and work towards them as they play a key role in my long-term goals. After working hard and moving out the next step would be to keep up with the industry and prove my worth to the company. Similarly as above mentioned, numerous resources would be able and available to assist me in upskilling myself and furthermore doing personal projects on the side will keep my mind fresh and keep me invested and focused in my field and up to date with the newest tech and methods available.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.

    Potential challenges would be to land that first job and proving my worth.
    Since it all basically comes down to just trial and error until you land the job, what I would do to elevate my chances are to learn communication and interviewing skills, I need to learn how to present myself in a professional manner and I need to learn how to deliver my knowledge in a way that is impressive. CodeSpace has facilities that will help with this as well as how to properly setup your CV. Furthermore building up an impressive portfolio will also go a long way.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.

    FreeCodeCamp offers a number of modules that will definitely help you to grow as a developer, further by engaging in programming communities on platforms like Reddit or Stackoverflow you will build up the confidence to help others and further your understanding and problem solving skills. Also, by keeping in touch with my fellow CodeSpace students we would be able to help each other in the future.
